# Insanity Blocker

I am tired to be trigerred or overwhelmed by contents that were intensionally written to cause strong feelings on people. Inspecting
those contents, I found that the majority part of them are not relevant for my daily life, but increases my feeling of unhappiness,
sadness, hopeless, agriness, uncertainty about the future, etc. So I decided that this is enough: not matter the website that I am visiting
to, I want to block those contents.

This project aims to implement that in the most simple way (at least for me) to allow me to quick take advantage of that capability. Here I am having a Greasemonkey compatible user script that, based in a list of keywords, will replace any content in the page that mentions it.
